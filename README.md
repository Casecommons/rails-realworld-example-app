# Sample application for CaseCommons DevOps test

Hello,

This is a tiny sample application we like to have our DevOps candidates deploy as a test

## You can:

* Use any platform you like
* Use any configuration management language or framework you like

## You must:

* Use postgres as the datastore and ensure the datastore is on a **separate** machine (or service) from the application

## We need:

* A link to your repository that has infrastructure-as-code that deploys and hosts this application
* A brief description of the infrastructure-as-code and how we can apply it
* Access to the postgres endpoint and whatever access is available to the node running the application
